# Project 4

## Scope Rules

- [ ] Both expressions in the when statement must be the same type.
- [ ] The type of the switch expression must be Integer.
- [ ] All the case statements in a switch statement must match in type. No coercion is performed.
- [ ] Arithmetic operators can only be used with numeric types.
- [ ] All list elements must be of the same type.
- [ ] In a list variable declaration, the type of the list must match the type of the elements.
- [ ] List subscripts must be integer expressions.
- [ ] Character literals can be compared to one another but they cannot be compared to numeric expressions.
- [ ] Only integer operands can be used with the remainder operator.
- [ ] All the statements in an if statement must match in type. No coercion is performed.
- [ ] In a fold statement, the list must be a numeric type.
- [ ] A narrowing variable initialization or function return error occurs when a real value is being forced into integer. Widening is permitted. In all other cases, the type must match.

## Type Coercion

- [ ] Int To Real data type conversions

## Semantic Checks

- [ ] Type Mismatch on Variable Initialization
- [ ] When Types Mismatch
- [ ] Switch Expression Not Integer
- [ ] Case Types Mismatch
- [ ] Arithmetic Operator Requires Numeric Types
- [ ] Undeclared Scalar
- [ ] Undeclared List
- [ ] List Element Types Do Not Match
- [ ] List Type Does Not Match Element Types
- [ ] List Subscript Must Be Integer
- [ ] Character Literals Cannot be Compared to Numeric Expressions
- [ ] Remainder Operator Requires Integer Operands
- [ ] If-Elsif-Else Type Mismatch
- [ ] Fold Requires A Numeric List
- [ ] Illegal Narrowing Variable Initialization
- [ ] Illegal Narrowing Function Return
- [ ] Type Mismatch on Function Return
- [ ] Duplicate Scalar
- [ ] Duplicate List

## Check for symbols 

- [ ] Verify checks for undefined symbols
- [ ] Add checks for duplicate identifiers
