# PROJECT 2

## Functionality
1. Parses all syntactically correct programs
   - [x] Include literals for real data type
   - [x] Add if/else/elif statements
   - [x] Create Fold statment
      - [x] Implement direction and operator
   - [x] Implement variable declaration for 0...N variables
   - [x] Implement parameter declarations for function header
      - [x] Allow for comma separated multiple parameters for functions
2. Productions correctly implement precedence and associativity
   - [x] Add binary arithmetic operators for:
      - [x] Mod
      - [x] Exponent
      - [x] unary minus
   - [x] Ensure precedence
3. Grammar contains no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce errors
   - [x] Ensure build completes without shift/reduce
4. Detects and recovers from all programs with single syntax errors
   - [x] Run syntax tests to ensure proper error recovery
5. Detects and recovers from a program with multiple syntax errors
   - [x] Run syntax tests to ensure proper error recovery

## Test Cases

1. Includes test cases that test all grammar productions
2. Includes test cases that test errors in all productions
3. Includes test case with multiple errors
